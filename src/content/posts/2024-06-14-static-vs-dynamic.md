I chose a static site generator instead of a dynamic website, because it frees me from worrying about servers and databases, the site will be served reliably, and it will load fast.

From many options, I chose [Astro](https://astro.build) because I wanted to build with NodeJS rather than Ruby, it seemed like a solid choise and I found a suitable theme.

I downloaded [bookworm-light-astro theme](https://github.com/themefisher/bookworm-light-astro/), modified its content, updated the dependencies to the latest versions and had a working website to start with.

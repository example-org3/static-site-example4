To provide non-techincal authors an UI to create and modify the content of the website I chose [StaticCMS](https://www.staticcms.org/) which will push changes to the [GitHub](https://github.com/) repo of the website.

The authors must have GitHub accounts that are added as collaborators in the repository, but they don't need to know much more about git.
